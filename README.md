# Discovering Short-Term Fatigue-Management Patterns: Power Naps vs. Coffee

## Project Description
The project involves conducting a data mining study based on the problem type of **pattern discovery**, rather than the problem type of prediction accuracy.
The project involves using a dataset available from the Kaggle platform to compare the effectiveness of power naps and coffee as a method to improve alertness.
The project emphasizes the use of discovery-oriented data mining techniques such as clustering, association rule mining, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction to discover the reasons why certain outcomes are achieved or not achieved based on the levels of sleep.

## Dataset
**Power Nap vs Coffee Effectiveness Dataset**
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prince7489/power-nap-vs-coffee-effectiveness-dataset

- Format: CSV
- Size: 500 rows x 11 columns
- Description: Simulated fatigue management sessions where the levels of sleep and the type and duration of the intervention are varied to measure the alertness levels before and after the intervention, as well as the levels of productivity and mood.

## Discovery Question
- What are the conditions for high levels of alertness and/or high levels of productivity/mood based on the levels of sleep, type and duration of intervention, and occupation?
- What are the conditions for the occurrence of side effects? Are there any anomalies in the responses based on similar conditions?

## Techniques to be used
- Clustering algorithms such as K-means and Hierarchical clustering.
- Association rule mining algorithms such as Apriori and FP-growth.
- Anomaly detection algorithm.
- Dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA.
